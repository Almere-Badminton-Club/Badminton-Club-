        <h3>Welcome to ABC!</h3>
        <p>
          The Almere badminton club is a badminton club that has been located in
          Waterwijk in Almere since 2022. Youth, adults and seniors of different
          levels and all ages have been playing here for years. Badminton often
          has a camping image, but it is certainly not that way! It is a sport
          where you use almost all your muscles and the higher level you play,
          the faster and more difficult it becomes. You can develop endlessly in
          this sport.
        </p>

        <h3> What makes ABC a unique badminton club?</h3>
        <p>
          We do more than just serious badminton. ABC is a fun club where we
          organize a lot for youth and adults/seniors. We are also a social and
          close-knit club and the regular badminton evenings are also a fun time
          together, where the youth, but also the adults, are trained. Knowing
          more? View and read more on the other pages or feel free to contact
          us.
