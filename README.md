## Frontend Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (alternative package manager)

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### Navigate to the Frontend Directory

If your repository contains both backend and frontend code, navigate to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project. You can use either npm or yarn.

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Install Axios and Bootstrap
Axios and Bootstrap are required dependencies for this project. Install them using npm or yarn.

### Using npm:

```bash
npm install axios bootstrap
```

### Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add axios bootstrap
```

### Import Bootstrap in Your Project
To use Bootstrap styles in your project, import Bootstrap CSS in  main.jsx file.

In src/main.jsx 
```bash
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
```


### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory to store your environment variables. Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```


### Run the Development Server

Start the development server to run the project locally. You can use either npm or yarn.

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you should be able to access the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.



### Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts**: If you encounter a port conflict, you can change the port by adding a `VITE_PORT` variable to your `.env` file:
  ```
  VITE_PORT=4000
  ```
  Then run the development server again.

- **API Issues**: Ensure that your backend server is running and the `VITE_API_URL` in your `.env` file points to the correct API endpoint.

### Description of Project

#### Frontend (React):
Design the UI:

Create components for displaying available slots, a booking , and a payment .
Use a state management library like Redux or React Context API to manage the application state.

#### Slot Selection:

- Display a list of available slots.
- Allow users to select a slot.

#### Booking:

- Once a slot is selected, save a booking  with relevant details (date, time, userName etc.).
Collect user information (name, contact details, etc.).

#### Payment Integration:

- Integrate a payment gateway for handling payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Use the payment gateway's React library or follow their documentation for integration.

#### Form Submission:

On successful payment, submit the booking details along with the payment information to your backend.


### Backend (Server-side):
#### API Endpoints:

- Create backend API endpoints to handle:
- Fetching available slots.
- Handling slot booking requests.
- Handling payment processing.

#### Database:

Use MongoDb database to store information about available slots and booked slots.

#### Payment Gateway Integration:

- Integrate with the payment gateway on the server side.
- Verify payment status before confirming the booking.

#### Send Confirmation:

- Send a booking confirmation email to the user.

### Security:
#### Secure API Endpoints:

Implement authentication and authorization for your API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Secure Payments:

- Ensure that sensitive payment information is handled securely. Use HTTPS, and never store payment information in your database.

#### Additional Considerations:
#### Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling on both the frontend and backend to provide a smooth user experience.

#### User Authentication:

If you want to allow users to view their booking history or manage their bookings, implement user authentication.

#### Testing:

Thoroughly test your application, especially payment flows, to ensure a seamless experience for users.

#### Compliance:

Comply with any legal or regulatory requirements regarding payment processing and user data.
